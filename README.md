### **_Description_**

#### Tic-Tac-Toe game made entirely with JavaScript! You can play against someone or play a computer. This project was assigned while attending the General Assembly bootcamp ([GA_README](/GA_README.md)), using only JavaScript wasn't required but I decided to implement it to challenge myself.
